"""
First, a few callback functions are defined. Then, those functions are passed to
the Dispatcher and registered at their respective places.
Then, the bot is started and runs until we press Ctrl-C on the command line.

Usage:
Example of a bot-user conversation using ConversationHandler.
Send /start to initiate the conversation.
Press Ctrl-C on the command line or send a signal to the process to stop the
bot.
